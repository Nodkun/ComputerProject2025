So since you guys =>(nihal and IDHANT (thoda sa moksh)) dont actually watch the vide which u dont code or dont have time to or kinda just forget
im forced to make this3 ig for sirs questions



What are arrays?
Arrays are like lists of items
syntax: type[] ArrayName = new type[];

Here we use 
public tile[] tile; in tilemanager class
and in order to store data of images (and collison)
we do tile[0(any index)]= new tile[];
then we simply do
tile.image=
or tile.collision = 

pretty simple i believe

so now we have given memory to store in the array how do we implement it

firstly for drawing the tiles

we use


    public void loadMap(String filePath)
    
       try 
        InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream(filePath);
        

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));

        int col =0;
        int row = 0;

        while (col<gp.maxWorldCol && row < gp.maxWorldRow)
        {
          String line = br.readLine();//read single line and print

          while (col<gp.maxWorldCol)
          {
            String numbers[] = line.split("");//splits the string

            int num = Integer.parseInt(numbers [col]);//changes it from string to int 

            mapTileNum[col][row]=num;

            col++;
          }
          if (col==gp.maxWorldCol)
          {
            col = 0;
            row++;
          }
        }
        br.close();

ive removed brackets for spacd

anyways here we use filepath to lead it to the world gen file

then we use buffered reader to read the file that is the world gen

there is a way to add spaces which we have to implement so that tiles past no 9  can be acsessed but dont have it rn

what is buffered reader u may ask

its similar to scanner in some ways
but in reality its faster than scanner can take large inputs

then we use buffered reafder to read a single line and split it to fursther use it
